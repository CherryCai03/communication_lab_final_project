# communication_lab_final_project

This is the final project for Machine Learning for New Interface

This project was completed by Ruijie (Cherry) Cai (rc3470@nyu.edu) in partial fulfillment of INTM-SHU - 120 Communications Lab , Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Shanghai Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as my own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designed with quotation marks), or parephrasing thereof - has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that: Submitting the same substaintially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
