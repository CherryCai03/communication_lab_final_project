# communication_lab_final_project

This is the final project for Communication Lab

This project was completed by Ruijie (Cherry) Cai (rc3470@nyu.edu) in partial fulfillment of INTM-SHU - 120 Communications Lab , Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Shanghai Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as my own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designed with quotation marks), or parephrasing thereof - has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that: Submitting the same substaintially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

# Abstract
For this project, I worked with my teammate Wei Wang and delivered a creative  Internet-based art project called Random. For this project, we used special designed gif and images along with the ASMR sounds to “shut the brain down” during the busy final time. The ASMR sound we used are all recorded in the podcasting room and manipulated later by using Audacity by ourselves. There was a full story-line embedded in this project. While guided by the narrator, users can explore the project by clicking, dragging, hovering using their mouse.
